# Cloud Native Go
This repo is a follow-along of a Udemy course given by Packt.

It covers things such as building a simple Go (microservice) webservice. Following this, the course focuses on how to create an image from said microservice, creating a container from the image and then running it. 

After covering Docker, it moves into working with Kubernetes, using a local Minikube instance. This taught me how to implement a simple hyper-v vSwitch and how to pull the previously created images from Docker hub into the Minikube environment. 

The Kubernetes environment has been deployed using pods, services, deployment files etc.
